# delete-branch-package-versions

This action will retrieve the list of versions for a GH Package in the provided organization and repository, then delete any package versions with a name that matches the pre-release format generated by [im-open/git-version-lite] (`major.minor.patch-<sanitized-branch-name>.<formated-date>`).  
  - To sanitize the branch name, the characters `a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and -` are kept and any other character is replaced with `-`.  

If the action runs into an issue deleting a specific package version, it will generate a warning that can be viewed in the Summary section of the workflow rather than failing.  Errors retrieving the package versions will still cause the action to fail though.

## Contributing

When creating new PRs please ensure:
1. The action has been recompiled.  See the [Recompiling](#recompiling) section below for more details.
2. For major or minor changes, at least one of the commit messages contains the appropriate `+semver:` keywords listed under [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
3. The `README.md` example has been updated with the new version.  See [Incrementing the Version](#incrementing-the-version).
4. The action code does not contain sensitive information.

### Recompiling

If changes are made to the action's code in this repository, or its dependencies, you will need to re-compile the action.

```sh
# Installs dependencies and bundles the code
npm run build

# Bundle the code (if dependencies are already installed)
npm run bundle
```

These commands utilize [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/#bundling-for-node) to bundle the action and
its dependencies into a single file located in the `dist` folder.

### Incrementing the Version

This action uses [git-version-lite] to examine commit messages to determine whether to perform a major, minor or patch increment on merge.  The following table provides the fragment that should be included in a commit message to active different increment strategies.
| Increment Type | Commit Message Fragment                     |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| major          | +semver:breaking                            |
| major          | +semver:major                               |
| minor          | +semver:feature                             |
| minor          | +semver:minor                               |
| patch          | *default increment type, no comment needed* |
